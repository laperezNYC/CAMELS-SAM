Welcome to the documentation for CAMEL-SAM!
===================================

CAMELS-SAM is the newest and third 'hump' of the CAMELS project: https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html. 

Like CAMELS, CAMELS-SAM is made up of more than 1,000 simulation products and galaxy catalogs for machine learning, covering a broad parameter space of cosmology and astrophysics. Unlike CAMELS, CAMELS-SAM span a periodic volume of :math:`(100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3` over 100 N-body only snaphots, and uses the Santa Cruz semianalytic model (SC-SAM) of galaxy formation and evolution.

See the :doc:`simulations` section for complete details about the suite, including the process for :doc:`access`. There are many various simulation :doc:`dataproducts` available, as well as a guide for :doc:`openSAM`.
